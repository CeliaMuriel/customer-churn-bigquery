This is an exercise to predict customer churn. I will test:

1.   Linear regression algorithm. I will build a model in the BigQuery UI, and I will connect Looker to it to show the results.
2.   Linear regression model. This time I will run iPython code from a AI Platform Notebook, and I will make charts in it.
3.   KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm in Python as well.
